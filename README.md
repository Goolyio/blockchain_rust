# blockchain_rust

A quick project to start playing around with the basics of block chain using rust. The goal is to create a fake decenteralised crypto using blockchain running locally.

## Todo
* Actually use RSA
* Multiple "nodes" running in parrallel locally
* Handle multiple block chains and handle switching to a longer chain
* Adaptive difficulty

## Aspirational
* Play around with using a proof of stake system instead of a proof of work
* Look at ways to decrease ledger size
  * Partitioning
  * Super nodes
